# python-challenge
 Module 3 Python Challenge.

 In this challenge we used python to clean and analyze data.

 In PyBank we generated from the total months of data provided:
    - The total change in profit/loss over the course of the months.
    - The average change month to month.
    - The months in which we saw the greatest and lease profits of the data provided.
    -  We output that data in an organized format in to budget_analysis.txt.

In PyPoll we calculated the winner of an election.
    - Totaled the vote count.
    - Calculated how many votes each candidate had and what percentage of the vote the accrued.
    - We declared the winner of the election based on the data provided.
    - We printed the results both in the terminal and output the data in to election_analysis.txt.
